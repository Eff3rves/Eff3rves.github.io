                    &emsp;This is one of my recent projects where I worked with a team of both designers and developers. <br><br>
                    &emsp;Demon Chef Mayhem is a game about a chef in kitchen hell (literally), using food ingredients as projectiles to slay enemies and collect their drop to make more food.<br><br>
                    &emsp;The game is built in Unreal Engine 5. 
                    I am the lead developer of this project where I had to do a lot of team management and coordination of the design and development team.
                    In addition, I was also responsible for making the toon shader, the UIs, integrating assests from the designer and the merging mechanic of the food.

                Gibson made its first production guitar in 1937 which had some popularity but suffered from  unequal loudness across the six strings.
                Gibson will eventually become a major electric guitar production company, making well-known models like the Les Paul and SG.
