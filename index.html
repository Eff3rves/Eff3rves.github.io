                    <p>
                        I am a game developer. I have been playing games since I was very young and it has always been my passion to create my own game.<br><br>
                        I was born in Shanghai, China and moved to Singapore when I was in Primary School. I am now in Nanyang Polytechnic studying for the Diploma in Game Development and Technology.<br><br>
                        My dream has always been to make my own game with a team of capable people. I have been gaining experiences through my school projects and my own projects to improve my ability to one day achieve that dream.
                        <br><br>
                        I am proficient in Unity, being a <a href="pdf/unityscore.pdf" target="_blank">certified associate programmer</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        I am currently studying for a Diploma in Game Development and Technology in NYP.
