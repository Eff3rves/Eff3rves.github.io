                    Electric guitars are a type of guitar. Guitars are fretted instruments
                     that typically have 6 strings. Electric guitar are guiatrs that require
                      external amplicfivation in order to have a louder volume.
                       Electric guitars use pickups to convert the vibrations from the string to 
                       electrical signal which can then be passed through loud speakers. 
                       Since electric guitars uses electric signals it also means that the cound
                        could be modified during playing to make
                     it sound more unique compared to other types of guitars.

                    To start playing electric guitar is actually pretty easy, however as mentioned before in the intro, 
                    since electric guitars need external amplification to have a louder sound, there are more equipments involved.

                Guitar amp is very important for electric guitars as it amplifies the sounds of the guitar itself so it can be heard at a louder volume.
                They also have different settings that could change how the guitar sounds. One example is the Gain which can add some distortion to the guitar sound.
