                    Hello, welcome to my portfolio.
                    <p>
                        &emsp;I am a game developer. I have been playing games since I was very young and it has always been my passion to create my own game.<br><br>
                        &emsp;I was born in Shanghai,China and moved to Singapore when I was in Primary School. I am now in Nanyang Polytechnic studying for the Diploma in Game Development and Technology.<br><br>
                        &emsp;My dream has always been to make my own game with a team of capable people. I have been gaining experiences through my school projects and my own projects to improvee my ability to one day achieve that dream.

                    My interests.
                    <p>
                        &emsp;I enjoy playing single player games like Elden Ring and Monster Hunter World. <br><br>
                        &emsp;I am a big fan of more storytelling games, putting hours into Persona 5 and Soulsbourne game. Sometimes I also play competitive games, recently got into League of Legends, though I am very bad at it. Playing a variety of games have opened my eyes to thee possibilities of games and the stories and messages it can bring to the world, which is why I chose a career in game development.<br><br>
                        &emsp;I like to keep my lifestyle active, exercising 5 times a week normally. I believe that with a healthy body, I will have a healthy mind, making it easier to work with people and keep up my enthusiasm for work and enjoy my day to day life.

                        &emsp;This is one of my recent projects where I worked with a team of both designers and developers. <br><br>
                        &emsp;Demon Chef Mayhem is a game about a chef in kitchen hell (literally), using food ingredients as projectiles to slay enemies and collect their drop to make more food.<br><br>
                        &emsp;The game is built in Unreal Engine 5. 
                        I am the lead developer of this project where I had to do a lot of team management and coordination of the design and development team.
                        In addition, I was also responsible for making the toon shader, the UIs, integrating assests from the designer and the merging mechanic of the food.
