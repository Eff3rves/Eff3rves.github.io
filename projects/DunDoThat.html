            &emsp;This is one of my recent projects where I worked with a team of both designers and developers. <br><br>
            &emsp;Demon Chef Mayhem is a game about a chef in kitchen hell (literally), using food ingredients as projectiles to slay enemies and collect their drop to make more food.<br><br>
            &emsp;The game is built in Unreal Engine 5. 
            I am the lead developer of this project where I had to do a lot of team management and coordination of the design and development team.
            In addition, I was also responsible for making the toon shader, the UIs, integrating assests from the designer and the merging mechanic of the food.
