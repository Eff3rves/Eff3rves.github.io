                &emsp;This is my current project that I am developing alone. <br><br>
                &emsp;The project is using Unity and Photon Pun2 for its multiplayer<br><br>
                &emsp;I always had a interest in movement shooters which is why I wanted to make this project. It is a small scale 1v1 shooter set on a small map where players can move around quickly with the movement skills provided.
                &emsp;The current project is now in Itch.io. <a href = "https://eff3rves.itch.io/vector-shot"> vector-shot</a>
