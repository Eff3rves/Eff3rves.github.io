            A fast pace movement shooter in first person. It is a 1v1 intense match where the player has to eliminate the opponent 3 times to win.<br>
            Players can choose between 3 different guns, rifle, shotgun and sniper to use in battle. Each gun also does a higher damage after using the powerup.
            <br> To power up the weapons, the player will have to move around the arena to charge up a "Speedometer". Players can choose to activate the powerup and enter "Overrdrive" which cause the weapons to do more damage.
            <br> Players can also choose one movement ability, either teleport or grapple to help charge up the bar speedometer faster. Each ability has a differnt max bar for speedometer making the player's approach different when using different abilities and encouraging players to try out different combinations of ability and weapon.
